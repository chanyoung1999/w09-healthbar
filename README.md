# Overview

The following program was designed for the healthbar I will be installing for the game I'm working on. I'm hoping to improve my knowledge in terms of C# programming from this experience.

The software was designed to control the health of the game's character. From the start the player will have 100 health and that would gradually be affected whenever he takes damage. The game's healthbar is also meant to have a gradient which would allow it to change colors depending on how much health the player has.

The main purpose of this work is to get to know better with game programming

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used Visual Code and Unity for the game and the healthbar program. I used the C# language to code the healthbar, so I could install that file into my unity game project
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

I am still facing errors with the gradient. While I succeeded in choosing the colors for it, I don't have the proper code to make it work. But I'm looking forward to fixing this issue.
